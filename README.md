# 🧠 TinyTitanGPT - Medical Note Generator

TinyTitanGPT is a mini transformer-based language model trained to generate structured clinical notes (in SOAP format) from short, natural-language medical prompts.

Built entirely from scratch in PyTorch, it demonstrates how transformer-based architectures can be adapted for real-world healthcare applications such as clinical documentation automation.

## 🧠 Technical Overview (In-Depth)

| **Component**     | **Detail** |
|-------------------|------------|
| **Language Model** | TinyTitanGPT is a custom-built, transformer-based language model inspired by GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer). It learns to predict the next character in a sequence, enabling it to generate structured clinical text from scratch. |
| **Framework** | Implemented using **PyTorch**, a dynamic deep learning framework that provides full control over tensor operations, backpropagation, and model design — ideal for building neural networks from the ground up. |
| **Layers** | The model consists of **6 stacked transformer blocks**, each containing self-attention and feedforward layers. These layers allow the model to learn hierarchical patterns and dependencies across different parts of the text input. |
| **Attention** | Each block uses **8 attention heads**, enabling the model to attend to multiple parts of the input sequence simultaneously. Multi-head attention allows the network to understand different types of relationships between characters (e.g., temporal, grammatical, semantic). |
| **Embeddings** | Each input character is mapped to a **128-dimensional vector**. This embedding layer helps the model learn distributed representations of tokens, making it easier to capture similarities and patterns in the training data. |
| **Training Data** | The model is trained on **character-level** sequences. Instead of using full words or tokens, it processes individual characters, which is useful for smaller vocabularies and allows learning of fine-grained syntax like clinical abbreviations. |
| **Sampling** | During text generation, **temperature** and **top-k** sampling strategies are used to control creativity and coherence. Temperature controls randomness (lower = more deterministic), and top-k restricts sampling to the top-k most probable next characters. |
| **Checkpoints** | The model saves its weights to disk every **500 training steps**. This allows users to resume training from the last checkpoint without losing progress, and to experiment with different generation techniques using the latest learned state. |
